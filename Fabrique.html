    <h2>Internship at Fabrique</h2>
<p> For my internship, I became a part of Fabrique's User Experience team. Over the course of six months, I had the opportunity to work with a diverse range of clients, some of them very different than others. This experience provided me with valuable insights into the dynamics of working in an agency, which involved collaborating with multidisciplinary teams, pitching and presenting to clients. I developed not only presentation skills, but also explored digital design beyond what I knew and what we learn in university.</p>
