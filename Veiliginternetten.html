            <p>Veiliginternetten is an initiative from the dutch government to help it's citizens be on the internet safely. Next to online information they offer seminars and workshops to help people understand safety on the internet.    </p>
            <p>The goal within this project was too find a new way to organize all the seminars and other online/ offline activities hosted by diffferent senders. The new page needed to be an overview of all these activities.</p>

<h2>Process</h2>
<p> It was hard to understand the current site at first. All the activities were sorted per week. Some of them were not really activities, but just online tools and the title of each card was the host/ sender of the activity and not the activity itself. </p>
<p> Ofcourse, the client already had an idea in mind about what they wanted: some sort of table in which we show all the activities per sender. So that is what I made at first. It seemed quite logical at first, but after the first sketch it made me realize it didn't make any sense at all.</p>
<p> What I had in mind since the beginning was just a simple agenda we all know. Where the title, date and location of the sender are the prioriteit, but also where it's easy to acces more information and where the sender is also dislpayed with some sort of importance </p>
<p>After showing the client, next to their proposal, also our proposal (an agenda), they agreed. So we could start building this.</p>

        <h2>Outcome</h2>
            <p>The new page for Veiliginternetten shows the upcoming activities in an user friendly way. The environment of an agenda is understood and help the user by understanding this new way to present these activities coming from different senders.</p>
