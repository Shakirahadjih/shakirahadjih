  <h2>Process</h2>
  <p>Challenges faced by the textile industry include issues related to supply chain management, transparency, and sustainability. As a team we looked into the potential benefits of using blockchain technology to address these challenges, such as increased transparency and trust between stakeholders in the supply chain.
  </p>   <p>Next, the team develops the concept of an interplanetary textile passport, which is a digital identity for each textile product that is stored on a blockchain. The passport contains information such as the product's origin, materials, manufacturing process, and sustainability credentials. The passport is accessible to all stakeholders in the supply chain, including manufacturers, retailers, and consumers, to ensure transparency and traceability of the product.
  </p>  <p>The team also came across some technical requirements and challenges associated with implementing the interplanetary textile passport. In our Research Report we discuss the need for a decentralized network, smart contracts, and interoperability with existing systems. In the report the potential barriers to adoption, such as the cost of implementing blockchain technology and the need for industry-wide collaboration are also acknowledged. 
  </p> <p>Overall, the team proposes a potential solution to the challenges faced by the textile industry by using blockchain technology to create an interplanetary textile passport. Our report provides a detailed analysis of the technical requirements and challenges associated with this solution, as well as its potential benefits for industry stakeholders.
