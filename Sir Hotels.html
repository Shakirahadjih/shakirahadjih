        <h1>Sir Hotels</h1>

        <p>Fabrique previously made the website for Sir Hotels and have won multiple awards for it. Visitors can easily find their way through the flowing and elegant transitions. The micro interactions bring Sir to life and provide a dynamic feeling that suits the target group. The interactions make the Sir experience tangible, along with bold typography and stunning photography. </p>

        <p>On the homepages you can find seven hotels which are displayed using the micro-animations that happen on scroll (on desktop only). The hotel wants to add more entities to this list. This would result in a very long homepage, where the content below gets hidden more and more. </p>

        <p>Together with Patrick (visual designer), we quickly sketched 3 new ways on how to present this long list of hotels in a way that we could keep the current design as much in place as possible. We decided to focus on mobile-first, because the current mobile design could use some love.</p>

        <h2>Process</h2>
        <p>In the current website there is a sticky navbar with anchor points on the side of the screen. This navbar gets hidden behind content and doesn't follow along on scroll. In the new designs we made a more prominent nav bar that stays sticky on top of the page and would react to user input. When the user is located in a certain area (hotel of Barcelona) the navbar will follow along and the Barcelona pill button will become active. Because this naviagtion can be sticky on top, we saved space on this sides. This meant the translation to mobile is possible and we can use this in the same way as desktop. To reduce the size of the pages we also made the area's smaller by 10%; on hover they will grow out 10%. </p>

        <p>The second approach would be to create 2 columns and create some sort of grid in the same way the imagery is displayed in the current design, where the remaining images would appear on hover. </p>

            <h2>Outcome</h2>

            <p>Due to the fact that Fabrique is really busy and this project was not yet sold, we didn't go further (yet) than sketching these three concepts. Little time was spend on it. Maybe in the future something will happen with these sketches.
