        <h1>Dierenbescherming.nl UX Audit</h1>

        <p>A new website of the Dierenbescherming went live in 2022. We took a look at the current website and used user data and did user tests to find where there is room for improvement.</p>

        <h2>Process</h2>
        <p>I started by doing an audit of the current website and certain pages, by taking screenshots and taking notes. I found out pretty quickly that the site is pretty clear and that there could be just some small improvements made. The only thing that really needed improvement was the menu and the way people were navigated through the site. The site consists of a main site, with two subsites. Immediately my advise was to improve the menu: make it consistent so that the menu behaves and reacts the same accross all sites. My second piece of advice was too kill the 'mijn dier is zoek' subsite. This was my advise, because they are competing with AMIVEDI. By creating something similar they are adding a platform which causes a distribution of missing animal posts accross different platforms, especially because AMIVEDI is the bigger platform.  Thirdly, we looked at Accessibility; as this could be improvement and it is something the Dierenbescherming finds important.</p>

            <h2>Process</h2>
            <p>Because finding more insights was relatively hard and user tests are always good; I conducted 5 user tests of 45 minutes. By giving the respondents a certain scenario and letting them navigate through the site, I found out more about what doesn't work well on the site. As well as new insights. The focus during the tests was mainly how users would navigate through the different sites & especially 'ik zoek baas'. </p>
            <p>The outcome of the tests in a nutshell:</p>

            <quote class="quote">When landing on the Dierenbescherming.nl site, nothing really was a problem. Most of the time the content made sense and navigation was easy. When I asked the user 'where they could' or 'if they could' adopt an animal, they had problems. Ofcourse you can ask yourself it that is the way people would navigate: they would probably land directly on the subsite from Google. But the way the menu works was very confusing: the user was constantly hopping between different sites (and so, different menu's), which confused the user a lot. Also, you want to show the people that land on the main site that the Dierenbescherming had adoption centers. Idem dito for the other way around: there is lot's of content and tips to be found on the main site that might be useful to people coming from the 'ik zoek baas' site. </li>

         <section class="align">
            <p>After conducting my own audit and doing 5 user tests I had found enought improvements that could be made. After discussing my work with Oscar (UX supervisor) & Mark (project lead), we planned a presentation to the client. This presentation went really well; in one hour I talked about the navigation, accessibility, how we could improve content & the flows
                and showed some low hanging fruit. </p>
                <p>The client was happy, this meant we could start working on certain things. A developer would start with the accessibility and I could improve certain UX questions. Below I try to show some new designs.</p>

            <h2></h2>
            <p>After these small improvements were made, I set up a small prototype. This time I would do 5 more tests (of 15 minutes), to see if the outcome would be better or different. It was! Sometimes navigationn was still a bit hard to understand and it was mostly copy that confused the respondents.   </p>

            <h2>Outcome</h2>
            <p> I had so much responsibility and could basically do this project on my own, as a junior UX Designer. This project was really working with the client instead of for the client. Understanding what they want and what they mean. Thinking of ways to advice them in certain ways and help them maintain the website. For the Dierenbescherming that is hard, because a big part of their crew works voluntarily. That also made it fun and educational, because trying to understand the client is a skill on it's own sometimes. </p>
