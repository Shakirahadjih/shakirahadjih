                <p>Sircle Collection came to Fabrique with the question to make a new homepage header which shows all that they have + a discovery widget to discover all the entities Sircle Collection has per city. </p>
                <p>I joined Fabrique halfway through this project. A lot of work had already been done, but the client wanted something bolder. Below is my process for creating the booking widget and the homepage header.</p>

            <h2>Process</h2>
            <p>Keeping the goal in mind, I've always been fascinated by animation in websites. So that is what I started playing with. 
                We had the goal to quickly show the broad portfolio of Sircle Collection. At the same time, it shouldn't give everything away, because there is still a lot to discover.</p>

            Motion design is more than making a website stand out visually. It also empahsizes the details to which users should pay attention, helping them navigate the site.
         </quote>

                <p>This was one of my first projects. I was really excited about it because I could explore motion design in a way I never did before. It wasn't just visually appealing, but it was also a UX question. The clients wish was too 1) have a focus on the logo and 2) let the user discover in everything Sircle Collection has.  </p>
