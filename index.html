                <p class="niks">I've always been fascinated by the intricacies of human behavior. It's what led me to dive deep into user experience design, constantly simplifying processes and making complex things a bit more manageable. My interest extends beyond just design; I'm intrigued by the intersection of (new) technology, sustainability, and ethics.

That's why I've taken on minors in blockchain and the relationship between technology, sustainability, and ethics. I believe it's crucial to question the speed and purpose of innovation. Are we racing ahead without considering the implications? Do we truly need every new innovation, or are we stuck in a cycle of repetition? Sure, efficiency is essential, but at what cost? 

I find myself yearning for a design world that embraces courage, individuality, and a genuine human touch.

As I navigate through my own design philosophy, I'm determined to inject courage into my creations, to resist the pull towards standardization, and to advocate for the human side of design. Let's break free from the chains of predictability and usher in a new era where every design tells a unique and compelling story. </p>
