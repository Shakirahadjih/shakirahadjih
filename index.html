                <p class="niks">I've always been curious about how people behave. This has shaped my interest in understanding individuals' needs, desires, and concerns. That's why I'm drawn to user experience design, constanly simplifying a certain flow and making complex things a bit easier.

                    In today's fast-paced world of constant technological advancements, I believe it's essential to approach new technologies with a critical eye. I'm particularly interested in how technology, sustainability, and ethics intersect. That's why I've pursued a minor in blockchain and a minor about the relationship between technology, sustainability, and ethics. I think it's crucial to ask questions about the speed and purpose of innovation. Are we moving too quickly? Do we really need every new innovation? Is innovation just a repetition of what we've seen before?
                    Just as I bring an empathetic and comprehensive approach to my design work, I apply the same approach to understanding emerging technologies. I aim to fully grasp their potential and challenges. I want to ensure that these technologies serve a greater good while following ethical principles, even if they introduce complexities and uncertainties. My goal is to use my analytical and creative skills to make these technologies easy to understand, user-friendly, and visually appealing. </p>
