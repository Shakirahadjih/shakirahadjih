                <p class="niks">I've always been fascinated by the intricacies of human behavior. It's what led me to dive deep into user experience design, constantly simplifying processes and making complex things a bit more manageable. In today's fast-paced tech-driven world, I approach new technologies with a critical eye. My interest extends beyond just design; I'm intrigued by the intersection of technology, sustainability, and ethics.

That's why I've taken on minors in blockchain and the relationship between technology, sustainability, and ethics. I believe it's crucial to question the speed and purpose of innovation. Are we racing ahead without considering the implications? Do we truly need every new innovation, or are we stuck in a cycle of repetition?

Ethics is at the core of my design philosophy. I want to ensure that my creations not only follow ethical principles but also address complexities and uncertainties. My goal is to leverage my creative skills to make complexity easy to understand, user-friendly, and visually appealing. In a world where design seems to be losing its diverse and human touch, I'm determined to infuse my work with courage, individuality, and a constant quest for improvement. </p>
